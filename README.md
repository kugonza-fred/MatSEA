MATSEA is a simple encryption algorithm, an improved version of the Hill Cipher and by no means immune to cryptanalysis as it has not been analysed by cryptanalysts.

### Description: 
MatSEA is a symmetric encryption algorithm that uses matrices to diffuse and confuse the plaintext into ciphertext.  

MatSEA encrypts plaintext by converting it into structured matrices and applying modular matrix operations along with a shuffle-based diffusion technique, making the original text significantly obfuscated. It uses carefully chosen cryptographically random key matrices and its encryption mathematical operations are under modulo 128 which enables efficient processing of printable ASCII characters. Decryption reverses the transformations through matrix inverses and structured unshuffling. The generated cipher text and key are serialized using base64 encoding to store and copy-paste encrypted data without encountering non-printable ASCII characters.
